-Main method is in the TerProjectMain

-In the game when you hit meteor, or when you pass a level only the horizontal component
 
 The game is designed this way since whem Y velocity becomes faster and faster, the game becomes unplayable.

 Ball can not make a contact with paddle, and it falls beneath the paddle (just like teleporting)  

-There is only two level, you pass to level to if you can manage to survive 60 second in game.

-Sometimes deciding whether game is runnig or finished is confusing, so there is a Game Status bar where you can understand if game is running (Game Status: CONTÄ±NUE) or finished (Game Status: FINISHED )

*******Additional Features*******

Heart (New Object)


It was too easy to lose a live in the game. To improve playability of the game and the game design a new object Heart is added to the game. If you have less than 3 live, and if you can manage to hit the Heart obect you will get 1 extra live. With this game time will increase and it will help player to collect points.


Changable Ball and Paddle Colors


To increase the visual aspects of the game, a console to change both paddle colors and ball colors. New colors are not quite interesting, but at least they give freedom to choose and make game more modifiable.

In the old game's design, the game ends if the player lost all of his/her lives. Restart button make game to return it's initial state. It increases games replayability.

To make game more challenging highcore is added to the game. Highscore will be updated when player dies. With this game will challenge player to increase it's highscore and it will increase the the game time.


Notes:

These are the additional features that I added to game. Sounds effects and gmae theme can also be added to the game but it is not decided yet.

These changes does not really improve the joy that palyer gets from the game, They just fixes the game design and make game more playable and acceptable.
